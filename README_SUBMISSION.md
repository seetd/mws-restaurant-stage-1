#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### What do I do from here?

1. In a terminal, check the version of Node you have `node -v`. If nothing is returned install Node.js on your machine from `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`
2. Create a keys.config.json based on the content in default_keys.config.json.
3. Run `npm install` in the application folder
4. Run `npm run build` in the application folder. This will setup a watcher on the src folder to rebundle when changes occur.
5. Open a new terminal and run `npm run start:dev`
6. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
